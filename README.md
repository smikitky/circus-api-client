# CIRCUS API Tools

Currently, this tool can:

- Show user's preference
- Download case data as MHD

## Install

**Node 18** or later is required.

After installing Node, run the following command to install this.

```
npm install -g @utrad-ical/circus-api-util
```

For now, it shows a warning like "The Fetch API is an experimental feature", but you can ignore this.
